# Java-Programs

Hello 👋 Java developers and aspiring Java learners. Are you trying to find the greatest repository to practice Java programs? You can find a repository here. This [repository](https://github.com/Ruban2205/Java-Programs/) contains a variety of Java programmes that illustrate basic to complex object-oriented programming concepts. This repository was created with love and effort to give students and developers the best, most easily understood concepts possible. It contains ten distinct concepts, each with two to five understandable sample programmes. If anyone encounters any faults or errors while browsing the repository. Please let me know by contacting me at info@rubangino.in. I'll offer the possibility to work with this repository 🤝.

**Java** - Java is a high-level, class-based, object-oriented programming language that is designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible.

### Object Oriented Programming 

Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a computer programming model that organizes software design around data, or objects, rather than functions and logic. An object can be defined as a data field that has unique attributes and behavior.

#### Four Pillars of Object Oriented Programming (OOP)

- Abstraction 
- Encapsulation
- Inheritance 
- Polymorphism
