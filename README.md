### Object Oriented Programming 

Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a computer programming model that organizes software design around data, or objects, rather than functions and logic. An object can be defined as a data field that has unique attributes and behavior.

#### Four Pillars of Object Oriented Programming (OOP)

- Abstraction 
- Encapsulation
- Inheritance 
- Polymorphism
