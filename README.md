# üìö Java-Programs

This repository contains a collection of Java programs that cover various concepts and topics in Java Object Oriented Programming. The programs are designed to help developers enchance their understanding and proficiency in Java. 

Java is a popular and widely-used programming language known for its versatility and robustness. This repository serves as a valuable resource for Java developers, providing a diverse set of programs that can be used for learning, reference, or a starting point for buildng more complex applications. 

Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a computer programming model that organizes software design around data, or objects, rather than functions and logic. An object can be defined as a data field that has unique attributes and behavior.

#### Four Pillars of Object Oriented Programming (OOP)

- Abstraction 
- Encapsulation
- Inheritance 
- Polymorphism

## üñ•Ô∏è Programs

The repository includes a wide range of Java programs, covering various topics and concepts. Some of the programs available in this repository are: 

- Basic programs to demonstrate the usage of variables, loops and conditionals. 
- Object-oriented programming examples, including classes, inheritance, and polymorphism. 
- Data structures and algorithms implementations, such as linked lists, stacks, queues, sorting algorithms, and searching algorithms. 
- File handling programs, demonstrating how to read form and write to files. 
- Multithreading examples, shocasing concurrent programming in Java. 
- Networking programs, illustrating client-server communication using sockets. 
- GUI (Graphical User Interface) programs, including examples using Swing or JavaFX.
